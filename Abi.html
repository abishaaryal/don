        <h5>- Song by Lana Del Rey </h5>
        <pre>
All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, oceans blue


Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream


All the lights are sparkling for you, it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues


Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream


The summer's wild and I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your Medell√≠n, tangerine dreams


Catch me if you can, working on my tan, Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man, happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain, ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait, now it's time to eat soft ice cream


Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Soft ice cream
